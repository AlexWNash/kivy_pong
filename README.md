This is a simple pong game using kivy as the gui. This game has a simple bot opponent.

Until I figure out how to package this properly you'll need to install kivy to run the file, https://kivy.org/doc/stable/installation/installation-windows.html

Planned improvements include:
  - main menu
  - difficulty selection
  - pop-up score messages
  - additional graphic options
  - other improvements tbd
